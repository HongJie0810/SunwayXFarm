This project was my very first group assignment, completed during my first semester. Itâ€™s a console-based system created for Sunway XFarms to help users explore vegetable subscription packages and farm kits. The system lets users add items to their cart and calculates the total cost, making it simple and convenient to manage subscriptions and purchases. Working on this assignment gave me hands-on experience with programming and teamwork, and it marks the beginning of my journey in tech development.
